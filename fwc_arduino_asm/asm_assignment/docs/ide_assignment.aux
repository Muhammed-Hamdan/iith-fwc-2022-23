If x = 1 for one clock period, the output z will be 1 for three clock periods before returning to the starting state. If x = 1 for two clock periods, the output z will be 1 for two clock periods before returning to the starting state. If x = 1 for three clock periods, the output z will be 1 for a single clock period before returning to the starting state. Construct a state diagram and implement your design with D F F s . The circuit when designed acts as a pulse width adjuster. }{1}{}\protected@file@percent }
